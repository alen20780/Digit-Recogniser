# Digit-Recogniser
The purpose of the project is to identify and predict the handwritten input digits from 0-9. It can be used in many real-life scenarios such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). 
# Vision
This project aims to develop a real-time handwritten digit recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system will utilize a webcam to capture images of handwritten digits and recognize them using three different machine learning models: Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
# Flowchart
User selects a machine learning model to use
Model is trained on MNIST dataset
Webcam captures images of handwritten digits
Image is preprocessed and fed into the selected model
Model recognizes the digit and displays the result
# Future Scope
Improve the accuracy of the models by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring other architectures
Integrate the system with other applications, such as a calculator or a game
Expand the system to recognize other types of handwritten characters or objects
